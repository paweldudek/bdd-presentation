# BDD Example for Presentation

An example project showcasing BDD-style approach when testing view controllers written in Swift.

This example accompanies my talk on [Behavior Driven Development](https://speakerdeck.com/paweldudek/wroclaw).

## Finding your version

This project has been used for a few presentation so far. Please take a look at tags (or versions on Github) if you're looking for a specific version. This project will of course be updated to reflect latest changes in dependencies (Quick, Nimble) and/or Swift.
